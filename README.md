Baileys UWA Submission for Module 6 challenge

## Results from WeatherPy Code:
### Temperature vs Latitude
For both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, there's a strong correlation between temperature and latitude, indicated by the high negative and positive r-values (-0.83 for the Northern Hemisphere and 0.76 for the Southern Hemisphere). This relationship suggests that as you move closer to the equator (lower latitudes), temperatures tend to increase and further away the lower the temperature gets. 
### Humidity vs Latitude
There's a very weak positive correlation between humidity and latitude in both the Hemispheres, as indicated by the low r-values (0.07 for the Northern Hemisphere and 0.06 for the Southern Hemisphere). This suggests that latitude has little influence on humidity levels.
### Cloudiness vs Latitude
In both hemispheres, there is a weak positive correlation between cloudiness and latitude, with a slightly stronger correlation observed in the Southern Hemisphere (r-value of 0.19) compared to the Northern Hemisphere (r-value of 0.03). This suggests that there may be a tendency for cloudiness to increase slightly in higher latitudes.
### Wind Speed vs Latitude
There is a very weak positive correlation between wind speed and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere (r-value of 0.13) and a weak negative correlation in the Southern Hemisphere (r-value of -0.15). These correlations suggest that latitude has little influence on wind speed.
